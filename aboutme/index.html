    <h2>Joseph Gyman</h2>
    <p>Hey Peeps, My name is Joseph Gyman and I am a Software Engineering Major. I'm 
    currently in Rexburg as an on-campus student but am from Stockton, California. 
    Something interesting about me is that I play competitive Ultimate Frisbee at a Club 
    level. Hope to meet you all and grow some friendships!</p>
